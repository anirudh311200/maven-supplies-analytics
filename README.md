# 📊 Tableau | Executive Sales Performance & Profitability Analysis

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project delivers an **executive-grade Tableau analytics solution** built to answer a single, critical question:

**What truly drives sales, profit, and loss — and why?**

Rather than maximizing visual complexity, this solution prioritizes **clarity, causality, and business logic**. Interactive dashboards and guided stories move beyond surface-level reporting to explain the **economic mechanics** behind performance — enabling leaders to make confident, defensible decisions.

This project is intentionally minimalist in design and maximalist in insight.

## 🧠 Executive Questions Answered

- Which regions and cities genuinely drive profitable growth?
- Are high sales translating into profit — or masking structural losses?
- How do discounts affect margins across sub-categories?
- Which products should be scaled, fixed, or deprioritized?
- Is profitability driven by volume, pricing power, or order economics?

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Capabilities Demonstrated

- Tableau Public (Desktop)
- Advanced calculated fields & parameters
- Conditional color logic for financial interpretation
- Interactive dashboard actions & cross-filtering
- Executive KPI (BAN) design principles
- Business-first analytical storytelling

## 📈 Executive Dashboard — Performance at a Glance

![Executive Dashboard](visuals/executive_dashboard.png)

### Purpose  
Provide leadership with a **single, authoritative view** of performance — while preserving the ability to drill into details instantly.

### What This Dashboard Enables
- Immediate visibility into YTD Sales, Profit %, Quantity, and Avg Discount
- Identification of geographic concentration and risk at the city level
- Target attainment analysis across regions
- Trend recognition through monthly sales and profit behavior
- Clear understanding of revenue mix by segment and sub-category

### Why It Matters  
This dashboard answers *“How are we doing?”* in seconds — without sacrificing analytical depth.

## 🌍 Geographic Performance — Sales & Profit by City

![Sales & Profit by City](visuals/sales_profit_by_city_map.png)

This map reveals **where revenue is created — and where profit is actually retained**.

- Bubble size represents total sales by city
- Color encodes profit percentage (loss → profit)
- Tooltips expose city contribution to state-level sales
- Filters allow rapid geographic isolation and comparison

**Key Value:**  
Surfaces cities that generate high revenue but destroy margin — a critical executive blind spot.

---

## 🎯 Sales vs Goal — Regional Accountability

![Sales vs Goal by Region](visuals/sales_vs_goal_by_region.png)

This view compares regional performance against predefined targets.

- Bars represent actual sales
- Vertical reference lines indicate goals
- Color logic instantly highlights success vs underperformance

**Key Value:**  
Transforms targets from static numbers into visible accountability.

---

## 📉 Sales & Profit Trend — Monthly Dynamics

![Sales & Profit by Month](visuals/sales_profit_by_month.png)

A dual-axis view combining:
- Sales (bars)
- Profit (line)

This chart exposes:
- Seasonality effects
- Divergence between revenue growth and profitability
- Critical inflection points over time

**Key Value:**  
Ensures growth is evaluated through a profitability lens — not revenue alone.

---

## 🧩 Revenue Mix — Sales by Sub-Category

![Sales by Sub-Category](visuals/sales_by_subcategory_treemap.png)

A treemap segmented by category and sub-category highlights:
- What products truly drive revenue
- How contribution varies by segment
- Where scale exists — and where it does not

Selective labeling preserves clarity while keeping focus on material drivers.

---

## 👥 Customer Concentration — Top Customers by Sales

![Top Customers by Sales](visuals/top_customers_by_sales.png)

This view identifies **revenue concentration risk** through a dynamic Top-N framework.

- Default view shows Top 25 customers
- Parameter allows executives to redefine “Top” instantly
- Visual separation between Top-Tier and non-Top-Tier customers

**Key Insight:**  
A small number of customers contribute a disproportionate share of revenue — a critical dependency to monitor.

---

## 📊 Dashboard — Drivers of Profit & Loss (Analytical Core)

![Drivers of Profit & Loss](visuals/drivers_of_profit_and_loss_dashboard.png)

This dashboard is the **engine of causality**.

Rather than describing outcomes, it explains **why they occur** by connecting:

- Sales & Profitability by Sub-Category
- Profit Margin by Sub-Category
- Discount Impact Analysis
- Avg Order Value vs Order Count

### Interaction Design  
Every visual is fully cross-filtered.  
Selecting *any* element dynamically reshapes the remaining views — enabling instant root-cause diagnosis without losing context.

---

## 📖 Story — Top Cities & Sub-Categories

### NYC: The Single Largest Sales Driver

![NYC Story](visuals/story_top_cities_nyc.png)

- NYC leads national sales contribution
- Strong profitability accompanies high volume
- Sub-category leaders:
  - Furniture → Chairs
  - Office Supplies → Binders
  - Technology → Phones
- Peak sales and profit occurred simultaneously in September 2018

**Insight:**  
NYC’s dominance is broad-based, not dependent on a single product line.

---

### Western Region: Sustained Regional Leadership

![West Region Story](visuals/story_top_cities_west_region.png)

- The West outperforms all regions in YTD sales
- Product leadership differs materially from NYC
- Demonstrates how **geography reshapes product economics**

**Insight:**  
What wins in one region may not win in another — regional strategy matters.

---

### Chairs: A High-Volume Sales Engine

![Chairs Story](visuals/story_top_cities_chairs.png)

- Chairs generated $91K in sales in September 2018 alone
- High-volume driver with moderate margins
- Reinforces the need to balance scale with profitability discipline

---

## 📖 Story — Sub-Category Profit & Loss Drivers (Critical Insight)

This story represents the **analytical peak** of the project — moving from observation to explanation.

---

### Tables: Strong Sales, Structural Losses

![Tables Loss Driver](visuals/story_tables_loss_driver.png)

Despite generating substantial revenue, **Tables** produce the **largest absolute loss**.

#### Root Cause Analysis
- Negative profit margin (–10.2%)
- Exceptionally high average discount (~27.8%)
- High order volume combined with low average order value

**Conclusion:**  
Losses are driven by **pricing and discount strategy**, not demand.

> High volume without pricing discipline converts revenue into recurring loss.

---

### Copiers: Low Volume, Exceptional Profitability

![Copiers Profit Driver](visuals/story_copiers_profit_driver.png)

Copiers demonstrate the inverse economic model.

- Extremely high profit margin (39.9%)
- Very high average order value
- Moderate discounting
- Low order count, high profitability per transaction

**Conclusion:**  
Pricing power and order economics — not volume — drive sustainable profit.

---

## 🧠 Why This Project Stands Out

- Designed for **executive decision-making**, not dashboard tourism
- Explains **why outcomes occur**, not just what occurred
- Uses Tableau as a **business reasoning platform**
- Prioritizes clarity, restraint, and analytical depth

---

## 🏁 Final Takeaway

This project demonstrates a complete analytical workflow:
from **executive overview**, to **performance diagnosis**, to **root-cause explanation**.

It shows how thoughtfully designed Tableau solutions can move beyond reporting — and become tools for **strategic judgment**.

Perfection here was not achieved by adding more visuals —  
but by **removing everything that didn’t earn its place**.
